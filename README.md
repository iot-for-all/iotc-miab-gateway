# IoT Central Edge Gateway Module for Manufacturing in a Box
This open source sample shows how to implement an Azure IoT Edge gateway module that interfaces with the [Microsoft OPC Publisher module](https://azure.github.io/Industrial-IoT/modules/publisher.html) to subscribe to industry standard OPC server data. The gateway module orchestrates the creation of IoT Devices that are registered and provisioned against an Azure IoT Central application. The provisioned IoT Devices receive pubsub data from the OPC server and send the data to IoT Central.
